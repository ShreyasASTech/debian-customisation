# Debian Customisation
These are the customisations for debian that I use regardless of the Window Manager of choice.

## Installation

Execute install.sh as **normal user** from a terminal:

```bash
 git clone https://github.com/shreyasastech/debian-customisation.git
 cd debian-customisation/
 .install.sh
```

For those who would like a single-line command:
```bash
 git clone https://github.com/shreyasastech/debian-customisation.git && cd debian-customisation/ && ./install.sh
```
