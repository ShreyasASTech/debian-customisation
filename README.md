# Linux Tweaks
These are the customisations for Linux that I apply regardless of which version or distribution of Linux I choose to use. Tested to work on any distribution of Linux that is based on Debian, Archlinux, NixOS, and RHEL. ðŸš€

I am hopeful that you might find at least some of them useful. ðŸŒŸ
